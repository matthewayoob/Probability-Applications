# Probability-Applications

Through my studies of Probability Theory below I worked thorough a plethora of miniprojects from game simulators, bootstrapping, the multiarmed bandits problem, etc. 
1. Combinatorial Theory

2. Discrete Probability

3. Discrete Random Variables

4. Continuous Random Variables 􏰀 

5. Multiple Random Variables

6. Concentration Inequalities

7. Statistical Estimation

8. Statistical Inference

9. Applications to Computing

Probability theory is now used as one of the primary methods for designing new algorithms to model such data, allowing, for example, a computer to make predictions about new or uncertain events. For example, most email systems now employ automated spam detection and filtering. Methods for being able to automatically infer whether or not an email message is spam are frequently rooted in probabilistic methods. Similarly, if you have ever seen online product recommendation (e.g., “customers who bought X are also likely to buy Y”), you’ve seen yet another application of probability in computer science. Even more subtly, answering detailed questions like how many buckets you should have in your a hash table or how many machines you should deploy in a data center (server farm) for an online application make use of probabilistic techniques to give precise formulations based on testable assumptions.
